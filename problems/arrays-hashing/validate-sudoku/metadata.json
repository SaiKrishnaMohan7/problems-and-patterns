  "description": "Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to Sudoku rules: each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box must contain digits 1-9 without repetition.",
  "hints": [
    "Can you use hash sets to track seen numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 box?",
    "How can you calculate which 3x3 box a cell belongs to? Try using (row / 3, col / 3)",
    "You can iterate through the board once and check all three constraints simultaneously",
    "The complexity is O(1) because the board size is fixed at 9x9 (81 cells)"
