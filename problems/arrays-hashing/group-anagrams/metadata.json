  "description": "Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.",
  "hints": [
    "Can you sort each string and use it as a key?",
    "What data structure would help group strings with the same sorted form?",
    "Alternative: Can you use character frequency counts as a key instead of sorting?"
