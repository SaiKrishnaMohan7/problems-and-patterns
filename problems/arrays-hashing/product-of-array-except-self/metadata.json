  "description": "Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.",
  "hints": [
    "Can you calculate the product of all elements to the left of each index?",
    "Can you calculate the product of all elements to the right of each index?",
    "Think about using prefix and postfix products"

  "real_world_applications": [
    "Calculating distributed metrics (total minus current node)",
    "Computing marginal costs in resource allocation",
    "Load distribution across nodes excluding self",
