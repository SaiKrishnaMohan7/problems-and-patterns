  "description": "Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.",
  "hints": [
    "Can you use a hash set to check for consecutive numbers in O(1) time?",
    "How can you identify the start of a consecutive sequence?",
    "If a number has a left neighbor (num-1), it's not the start of a sequence",
    "Only count sequences starting from numbers with no left neighbor to avoid duplicate counting"
  ],
  "real_world_applications": [
    "Detecting network partition windows",
    "Finding continuous availability periods in monitoring",
    "Log correlation by timestamp ranges",
    "Identifying contiguous memory blocks"
