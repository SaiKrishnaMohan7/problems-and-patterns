# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

## Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```
nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```
nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]
```

**Output:**
```
9
```

**Explanation:**
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Therefore its length is 9.

## Constraints

- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

## Follow-up

Can you implement it in O(n) time complexity?

## Notes

- The sequence doesn't need to be contiguous in the original array
- Duplicates don't affect the result
- The key insight is to use a hash set for O(1) lookups
- Only start counting from numbers that are the beginning of a sequence (no left neighbor)
